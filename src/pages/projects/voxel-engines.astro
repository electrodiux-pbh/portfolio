    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Spark of Creation: My First Voxel Engines</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      My journey into game engine development began with a fascination for voxel-based worlds. Over the years, I've developed multiple voxel engines from
      scratch, each one a stepping stone in my understanding of OpenGL and low-level programming. I started with Java, the first language I mastered, and used
      it to build my initial engine. This foundational experience was crucial, as it stablished a solid knowledge base.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Pushing the Boundaries: From Java to C++</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Driven by a desire to learn C++ as a new language, I decided to transition my engine to C++ as a learning experience for the language and more
      voxel-stuff. This was a significant learning curve, but it provided an invaluable opportunity to delve into memory management, performance optimization,
      and system architecture. Sadly, many of these early iterations are lost to time, but the lessons learned have been foundational to my growth as a
      developer.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">A Lost Legacy, A Future Vision</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      While the code from my past projects may be gone, the knowledge and experience I gained are not. These projects have given me a profound appreciation for
      the complexities of game development and graphics programming. Now, with a wealth of experience behind me, I am channeling my passion into a new
      voxel-based game called "Industrialized," under my personal brand, Electrodiux.
